### Submit and issue or idea

If something doesnt seem quite right or something is missing from the book, please [raise an issue via the GitHub repository](https://github.com/practicalli/neovim/issues) explaining in as much detail as you can.

### Considering a Pull request?

Before investing any time in a pull request, please raise an issue explaining the situation.  This can save you and the maintainer time and avoid rejected pull requests.

Please keep pull requests small and focused, as they are much quicker to review and easier to accept.  Ideally PR's should be for a specific page or at most a section.

A PR with a list of changes across different sections will not be merged, it will be reviewed eventually though.
