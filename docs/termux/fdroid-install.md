# Install Termux via the F-Droid App

Visit the [FDroid app](https://f-droid.org/) website and download F-Droid, which saves an F-Droid.apk file.  Android may display a security prompt stating the browser does not have permissions to install software.  The popup should include a configure link that opens the Android settings to allow the browser to install software.

F-Droid should now be installed and its icon added to the Android system alongside all other Android apps.

Open the F-Droid App and allow it to update its repositories, to ensure the latest list of apps are shown.

Search for the **Termux** application, clicking on the Termux name if more details are required.

Select the Install button.
